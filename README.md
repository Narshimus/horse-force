A one week project inspired by the podcast "My Brother My Brother and Me". Horse-force is a front end web game that presents users with two horse names, one is a real name and the other is false. The results can be pretty hilarious. The project was intended to demonstrate mastery of JQuery, HTML CSS, and AJAX.
